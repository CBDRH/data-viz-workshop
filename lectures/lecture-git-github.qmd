## Version control with `Git` and `GitHub` {.title-slide}

<img src="../images/github-mark-white.png"></img>

## The challenge

As data analysts, we produce a lot of files

* code 
* figures 
* tables 
* reports 

Organising these files is an important, albeit often unglamorous, part of our job.  


## The Challenge

**Managing versions** What do you do with old code? 

**Ensuring reproducibility** Can others reproduce your results? What about your future self? 

**Facilitating collaboration** Can other team members easily contribute?


## The old school solution ðŸ›µ {.smaller}

The old school solution combines many practical strategies:

::: {.incremental}
* Using file naming conventions to track different file versions 

    * analysis-16jun2024.do 
    * analysis-19jun2024-mh.do 
    * analysis-final.do 
    * analysis-final-final.do

* Note changes directly in code comments or separate documentation

* Use shared folders, google drive etc 

* Share code and code snippets over email, slack etc

## The old school solution ðŸ›µ

> This is ok(ish) for one person working on a small project. But if the project is **large**, involves **many people** or goes on for a **long time** this approach very quickly breaks down 

## The new school solution ðŸš€

The new school solution is to use dedicated **version control software**. 

There are a few options out there but by far the most popular choice is the combination of **git** + **GitHub**

Git is software for tracking different versions of code files you are working on **locally**.
