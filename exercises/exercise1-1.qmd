# The End Goal

Let's start with the goal in mind! Here it is---a 100% stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of self-rated health status for 8 states and territories.

The simple chart format is enhanced using techniques covered in this workshop.

* **Ordering** The states and territories on the y-axis are ordered from top to bottom by the proportion of respondents describing their health status as Very good or Excellent. 
* **Colour** The chart uses a familiar traffic-light colour scheme, to distinguish between <span style="color: #D7191C;">Poor</span> and <span style="color: #1A9641;">Excellent</span> self-assessed health.
* **Text hierarchy** The main chart title is an informative title highlighting the key message. A descriptive subtitle explains in more detail what is plotted in the chart while the data source is provided in the footnote. 
* **Annotation** Text annotations indicate the percentage response for each category. Note that the colour for these labels has been carefully chosen to contrast against the background colour and the labels have been suppressed for the 'Poor' category, to avoid overflow.
* **Story telling** As well as having an informative chart title, the keywords <span style="color: #1A9641; font-weight: 600;">Excellent</span> and <span style="color: #A6D96A; font-weight: 600;">Very Good</span> are emphasised with bold font and appropriate colours to help connect the title to the data and reinforce the message.

## The data

The data for this plot come from the National Health Survey (NHS) 2022, a face-to-face interview survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and designed to collect information on health behaviours, conditions prevalence, and risk factors in Australia. You can read more about the survey on the ABS website [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/national-health-survey/latest-release).

These data are openly available for download in `.xlsx` format from the [ABS website](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/national-health-survey/latest-release#data-downloads:~:text=Download%20XLSX,%5B79.57%20KB%5D) and a copy is also included in the workshop repo in the file `national-health-survey-2022-table-2.xlsx`.
