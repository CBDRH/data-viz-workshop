# Aims

In this exercise you will use `ggplot2` and other tools to transform your tidy data frame to an attractive chart. You will geoms as the basic building blocks, Essentially, we will use code to go...


:::: {.column-page}

::: {layout-ncol=2}

**From this tidy dataframe...**

**To this nice chart!** 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
load("exercises/3-clean-data/vis1.Rda")
DT::datatable(df1Clean,
              options = list(pageLength = 7, 
                             searching = FALSE,
                             lengthChange = FALSE))
```

# How to complete this exercise

This first data visualisation exercise is fully guided---just follow the steps and copy-paste the code snippets into your own code file to build up the visualisation code. 

Note that many of the steps are incremental, and involve editing the previous code. For example, in one step you will use this code to plot a simple chart.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| class-source: "numberLines"
ggplot(
  data=df1Clean,
  aes(x = percent, 
      y = state, 
      fill=status)) + 
  geom_col()
```

In the next step, you need to add a new library and update the y mapping in `aes()`. The lines that change are highlighted, as below. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "1,6"

library(forcats)

ggplot(
  data=df1Plot,
  aes(x = percent, 
      y = fct_reorder(state, totalHealthy), 
      fill=status)) + 
  geom_col()
```

You should add these new lines in your code to see how the chart is incrementally improved. You could also copy over the whole chunk replacing the previous one in your code, but this is less conducive to learning. 

Notice the <span style="color: #6c757d; font-weight: 600">{{<fa play>}} Code</span> button allows you to expand and collapse the code snippets. These are usually not expanded by default, especially for large code sections, so you need to click the button to see the code.
